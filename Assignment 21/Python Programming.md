Python Programming
1: Design a Python application that creates two threads named Prime and NonPrime.
Both threads should accept a list of integers.
The Prime thread should display all prime numbers from the list.
The NonPrime thread should display all non-prime numbers from the list.
2: Design a Python application that creates two threads.
Thread 1 should calculate and display the maximum element from an list.
Thread 2 should calculate and display the minimum element from the same list.
The list should be accepted from the user.
3: Design a Python application where multiple threads update a shared variable.
Use a Lock to avoid race conditions.
Each thread should increment the shared counter multiple times.
. Display the final value of the counter after all threads complete execution.
10: Design a Python application that creates two threads.
Thread 1 should compute the sum of elements from a list.
Thread 2 should compute the product of elements from the same list.
Return the results to the main thread and display them.
